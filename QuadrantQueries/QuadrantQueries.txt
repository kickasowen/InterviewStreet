Quadrant Queries (30 points)

There are N points in the plane. The ith point has coordinates (xi, yi). Perform the following queries: 


1) Reflect all points between point i and j both including along the X axis. This query is represented as "X i j"
2) Reflect all points between point i and j both including along the Y axis. This query is represented as "Y i j"
3) Count how many points between point i and j both including lie in each of the 4 quadrants. This query is represented as "C i j"

Input:
The first line contains N, the number of points. N lines follow. 
The ith line contains xi and yi separated by a space. 
The next line contains Q the number of queries. The next Q lines contain one query each, of one of the above forms. 
All indices are 1 indexed.

Output:
Output one line for each query of the type "C i j". The corresponding line contains 4 integers; the number of points having indices in the range [i..j] in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quadrants respectively.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= Q <= 1000000
You may assume that no point lies on the X or the Y axis.
All (xi,yi) will fit in a 32-bit signed integer
In all queries, 1 <=i <=j <=N

Sample Output:

Explanation
 
When a query says "X i j", it means that take all the points between indices i and j both including and reflect those points along the X axis. The i and j here have nothing to do with the co-ordinates of the points. They are the indices.  i refers to point i and j refers to point j
 
'C 1 4' asks you to 'Consider the set of points having index in {1,2,3,4}. Amongst those points, how many of them lie in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quads respectively?' 
The answer to this is clearly 1 1 1 1.
 
Next we reflect the points between indices '2 4' along the X axis. So the new coordinates are :
1 1
-1 -1
-1 1
1 1
 
Now 'C 3 4' is 'Consider the set of points having index in {3,4}. Amongst those points, how many of them lie in the 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th quads respectively?' Point 3 lies in quadrant 2 and point 4 lies in quadrant 1. 
So the answer is 1 1 0 0
